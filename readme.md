Try to beat my AI in TicTacToe. 
I promise you can never win as the AI traces all of the combinations and chooses the turn that will lead to the combination in which there will be at least draw.
But this AI is slow in choosing a turn. I think one of the way of optimizing that is to store all of the combinations in a tree. Try to do that and connect me if you have done it.
